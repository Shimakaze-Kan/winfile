# ![icon](winfile.png) Windows File Manager (WinFile)

## Modification

I really like WinFile, so I decided to use it on a daily basis because it allows me to do many things much faster and more conveniently than the default file explorer in Windows. Unfortunately, it didn't have the 'Open with' option in the context menu, so I added it.
